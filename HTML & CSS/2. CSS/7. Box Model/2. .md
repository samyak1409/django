How the box model works:
 
1. The inside of the box model, the very center, is your actual **content**. This is going to be your text, image,
whatever it is that takes up that space, is going to be there.

2. The very next thing is **padding**. Padding is essentially just spacing b/w your content and your border. So on a 
button e.g., this is what allows you to create space b/w your letters of your button, and the actual border around your
button with the background. Background also goes on the padding because the background is inside the border.

3. Then we have the **border** which is self-explanatory, whatever size you make the borders, how wide the border is
going to be.

4. And then lastly we have our **margin**, which is going to be the space on the outside of the border, which helps you
space elements out from each other.

- Note that margin is meant to space elements around other elements, and padding is meant to space elements around their
own border or to add spacing b/w the element and their actual background.
