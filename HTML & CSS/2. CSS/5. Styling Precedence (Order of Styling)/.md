- The highest priority is given to the id selector, then class selector, and then at the end, element selector.
- If the priority is same then the style which is defined last applies.
- Note that inline styling if there, will always override any other styling.


- Essentially, the easiest way to look at this is to first count the number of ids in the selector, if the number of
ids is equal, then go onto the number of classes in the selector, if the number of classes is equal then, finally go on
to the number elements in the selector.
- If that is also equal, then whichever one is defined last is going to be the one that's applied.
- If we have an inline style, this will override everything. Anything defined inline overrides everything in your style
sheet no matter what.
