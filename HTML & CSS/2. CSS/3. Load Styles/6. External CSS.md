The final and best way to define CSS styles is to use a separate CSS file, and link to it from the HTML.

All the styles for the entire webpage can be defined in one or more CSS files, and they can be added to any web page by
using a simple link element inside the head.

Using external CSS files like this is the best way to use CSS since:
- It separates the presentation and contents of websites.
- Allows re-usability of styles across the website.
