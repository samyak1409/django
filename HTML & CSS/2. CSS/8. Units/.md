The various different units that we can use:

1. **Pixels:** Fairly self-explanatory, they're the unit that you use most the time when defining content sizes, and is 
going to be a set-fixed width on every size screen.

2. **Percentage:** Also fairly self-explanatory, and will take up whatever percentage of the given width that the object
has inside its parent. So, if we make width 10%, it will be 10% of the width of the current screen size, since the 
entire width here is how much space we have to work with.

3. **em:** Mostly used for fonts and font related situations like padding around fonts. It scales off of the actual font
size, so if your font size is 16 pixels, then 1 em equals 16 pixels, 2em would be 32 pixels, and so on.

4. **rem:** Similar to em (scales off of your font size).

- Diff. b/w em & rem: rem scales off the font size of the root of your document, so the very-very base level of our 
browser, where if we went into the settings and scaled our font size, it would scale off of that. While em scales off of
the parent, so if a box has a parent of body, so if we change the font size on the body, our actual box gets wider. But
if we used rem there, the size of the box stays the same.
