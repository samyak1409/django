<!-- Cool Trick: If we type an exclamation mark and then press tab we get a basic HTML boilerplate which means a basic
HTML template. -->

<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

  <!-- meta elements: Gives information about the web page. -->

  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- With this meta element we're defining the character set used in this html document.
  The character set that we use most of the time these days is UTF-8 which can represent almost all characters in the
  world. -->

  <meta name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
  <!-- meta element for configuring the viewport.
  The viewport is the visible area of a web page, on a mobile device or on a tablet our viewport is smaller.
  On desktop, we can change the size of the viewport by resizing the browser.
  With this element we're defining the initial width and zoom factor for the viewport.
  We'll talk about this in more detail in the future, for now all I want you to know is that we need this element so our
  web pages look good on all devices (mobiles, tablets and desktop computers). So as a best practice every web page
  should have at least these two meta elements. -->

  <!-- We have more meta elements, e.g. we have this element for defining keywords on a web page. -->
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS">
  <!-- In the past, these keywords were heavily used for search engine optimization but these days most search engines
  don't put too much weight on these keywords, but we can still use them to define the keywords that represent this
  page. -->

  <!-- Another meta element for defining a description for this page.
  We can type a description for this page, what we type here will appear on Google or other search engines when someone
  searches for a website, the text below the website link comes from this element. -->
  <meta name="description" content="Open this link for a cookie. :)">
