[Validating Web Pages](https://youtu.be/qz0aGYrrlhU?t=2105)

As we write code, we may run into problems, if you have a typo in our code, or don't use the right syntax or grammar, 
our web pages may not look as expected. In these situations, we can use a validator to identify the potential errors in 
our code.
