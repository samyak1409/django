    <!-- Give resources (images etc.) descriptive names, this is a small search engine optimization tip, when we provide
    descriptive names for our images, search engines can better understand and index our pages.
    The alt attribute is used to provide textual description of the image it's not compulsory, but is highly recommended
    for a number of reasons:
    1) To make our page accessible to visually impaired people. These people use a screen reader to read the web out to
    them, so with this alternative text we can tell them what we are showing on the page, and that means we should write
    a good meaningful description here. Don't write something like image or image1, that is pointless.
    2) Help search engines read this text and understand what we're providing here.
    3) If this image cannot be loaded for some reason, the alternative text is shown. This can happen if there is a
    network connectivity issue, if the user gets disconnected, they can still see the alternative text. -->

    <img src="../Images/Lamborghini.jpg" alt="Gray Lamborghini in Parking Area">

    <!-- Now, to make the img smaller, let's use CSS. -->
