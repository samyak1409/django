  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
  <!--
  => We have six heading elements. Heading 1 represents the most important heading and heading 6 represents the least
  important heading.
  => One common mistake that I see amongst a lot of people is that they choose these headings based on their size. That
  is not how you're supposed to use headings, because the size can always be changed with CSS, it's a matter of styling.
  We should use these headings to create a hierarchy, so every web page should have one and only one h1 element. This
  heading represents what this page is all about, nothing happens if you have multiple h1 elements, but this is going to
  confuse search engines, they're not going to figure out what this page is really all about.
  => After we use h1 then we should use h2, then h3 and so on, we should not jump to h4, so we have a hierarchy. This is
  how we should use these heading elements. The better we can represent the structure of our document using HTML, the
  better search engines can read and understand our content.

  <!-- p (paragraph) element: Used for displaying some text. -->
  <p>I'm learning <em>HTML</em>!</p>
  <!--
  => Sometimes we want to emphasize a part of our text, let's say the "HTML" word here.
  To do that, we can wrap it inside an em or emphasis element.
  Let's hover over it and see what the tooltip says. It says the em element represents stress emphasis of its content so
  whenever we want to emphasize some content we can wrap it inside the em element.
  By default, browsers display emphasized content in italic, but don't assume that whenever you want to display italic
  content you should use the em element, because, THE PURPOSE OF THE EM ELEMENT IS TO EMPHASIZE CONTENT IN OUR HTML
  DOCUMENT AND THIS HELPS SEARCH ENGINES EXTRACT IMPORTANT CONTENT IN OUR DOCUMENTS.
  => Anything to do with styling should be done in CSS. We can change the default style of emphasize element and remove
  the italic (in the head section, add the style element, and there, define a rule for emphasized content).
  => We have a similar element in HTML called strong, let's hover over it and see what the tooltip says. The strong
  element represents strong importance, seriousness or urgency of its contents. Conceptually, it's kind of similar to
  the emphasis element. So where you should use it really depends on your context on your content. By default, strong
  elements are displayed as bold, but once again we can always change the styling.
  => Also, in the past we had an element called i which was short for italic. If we use this element we get the same
  result as before, our content is displayed in italic. But this element is considered deprecated because HTML is not
  meant for styling, it should only be used for structuring content. So don't use the i element to display content as
  italic.
  => We had another element called b which is short for bold. So whenever we wanted to make something bold we use this
  element, but once again this element is considered deprecated because styling should be done in CSS and not in HTML.
  So don't use b or i elements.
