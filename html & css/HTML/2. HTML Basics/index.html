<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- With this we can tell browsers that this is an HTML5 document, it's called doctype declaration.
BTW HTML is not a case-sensitive language but conventionally speaking we type everything in lowercase except doctype,
this is just a convention, we could type this in lowercase and that's perfectly fine. -->


<html>
<!-- opening tag -->


    <!-- We use the head element to give browser information about this page. -->
    <head>

        <title>My First Web Page</title>
        <!-- specifies the title of this page that appears in the tab -->

    </head>


    <!-- Inside the body element we're going to add elements that would appear on our page. -->
    <body>

        <!-- Here's our image element now this image element is different from the other elements we have created so far,
        there are two differences here:
        1) here we don't have a closing tag we only have an opening tag because the image element cannot have any child
        elements (in the previous versions of HTML we used to add a forward slash in the end and this represents a
        self-closing tag, but we don't have to do this in HTML5)
        2) here we have two attributes src and alt, with these attributes we can supply additional info about an
        element -->
        <img src="../Images/Samyak.jpg" alt="Error displaying the DP...">
        <!-- src specify the path to our image -->
        <p>@samyak1409</p>

        <!-- That's it! Now back in the browser, we have image and right below that two text elements, unfortunately
        they're not very visible, because we haven't applied CSS yet. As I told you before, we use HTML to define the
        structure or the building block of our web pages. In the next lesson I'm going to show you how to apply CSS, so
        our page looks good. -->

    </body>
