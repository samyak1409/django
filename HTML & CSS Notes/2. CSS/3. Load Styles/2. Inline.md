This is a terrible idea though, since:
- HTML is meant for the content only, and mixing CSS styles into your HTML elements adds presentation to your HTML,
which is meant for CSS files.
- It prevents us from reusing those styles anywhere else since they are written into the actual HTML element.
- Lastly, depending on the styles you use inline, your page may load slower.
